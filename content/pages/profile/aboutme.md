Hi this is a bit of a profile about me.

 * Software Developer
 * Engineer
 * Systems Administrator
 * Fixer
 * Builder
 * Tinkerer

As part of higher education I originally obtained a degree in Electronic Engineering, 
although my main interest is in software development (mostly .Net C# / VB, although I've written code in a lot of different languages over the years)

Outside of work, I'm part of a local hackspace which involves engineering and re-purposing hardware for different uses.

I love the unique robot designs from anime.
