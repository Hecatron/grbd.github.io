Well I've finally gotten around to writing a new blog.
I'll be using this to post some of the details of personal projects I'm working on, along with some of the bits of interesting information I've picked up
from different sources.

I'm currently using pelican to generate the blog and mkdocs for the project sites, since python is one of my favoured languages.
I plan on updating and modifying the theme once I have more time with header and footer images, but for now I'm using one of the default pelican themes.
