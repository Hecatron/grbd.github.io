## Overview

For a while now I've been building my own CNC at home.
It's a OX CNC from [Ozznest](http://ooznest.co.uk/3D-Printer-CNC-Kits-Bundles/OX-CNC-Machine/OX-CNC-Full-Kit)
the smallest size of 500mm x 750mm.

To begin with I tried using a small dremmel clone spindle from Clas Ohlson
This worked with mdf at about 250mm/min feedrate with a 1mm pass, but it was slow
With a dremmel there are also limitations on the size of the milling bit I can use
and I found if I used the chuck instead of a collet, it could result in the bit dropping out after a while during milling.

I was thinking about upgrading to a 2.2Kw chinese spindle from aliexpress.
But your looking at around 250 UK Pounds or more for one with a decent speed controller (VFD)


## Aldi Router

As a really cheap alternative I managed to pick up a 25 Pound Router from Aldi's
With a bit of hacking it's possible to mount these to a CNC with an ER11 Collet.
The power rating is around 1.25Kw which is quite good for a CNC

The model is a

Note it looks like this has now sold out, but I did find something very similar at screwfix for about 50 Pound

## Router Dissasembly

There's a few bits we need to remove from the router in order to make it usable with the CNC



## Collet Adapter

Next we need to mount a ER11 Collet on the end of the machine.
These are a fairly common size collet for th 300W hobby spindles that are used on CNC's these days.

Next we need some collets for different size bits

## Mounting Bracket

The spindle is not a square or easily mountable shape so I tried looking into 3D scanning the surface using Photogrammetry
but probably because of the colour of the object I didn't get very far with that approach.

So Instead I came up with a box shaped design.
